# HP-Multimeter-Log-HP85
HP 3478A Multimeter and other Log long-therm measurements for HP85

The software is programmed in HP BASIC on a HP85 / HP85B with EBTKS card. The program used the DATETIME function of the EBTKS card to display date and measurement time. For the development, an EBTKS card is needed for the time being, e.g. for the real-time clock and other functions. This enables the simple storage of the measurement data.

The software is under development and more features will be added.

The following devices are supported:
- HP 3455A
- HP 3456A
- HP 3478A
- HP 3457A
- HP 34401A

The following functions will come soon:
- Selection of measurement function on HP multimeter such as V DC, V AC, 2Wr Ohm and 4Wr Ohm.
- Display of the maximum, minimum and average measured values.
- Selection of an external printer.
- Saving the measured values on a drive.
- Print a graphic plot after the measurement.
